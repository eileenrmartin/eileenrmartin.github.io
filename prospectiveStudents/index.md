## Prospective Students, Postdocs

Our group regularly has funded research projects going on that can support research assistants. Email me if you're a motivated, curious prospective postdoctoral researcher, graduate student or undergrad interested in doing research on: 
* imaging science 
* inverse problems 
* computational science 
* seismic imaging and source detection 
* data compression
* working with large streaming data sets
* fiber-optic sensing (or other large-scale geophysical sensing methods)
* signal processing

In January 2022 I will be moving to Colorado School of Mines in Golden Colorado, to work as an assistant professor in the Department of Geophysics (60%) and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (40%). Students who wish to pursue their Ph.D. with me can apply through either department depending on their background and goals. More details about Mines' Geophysics graduate programs can be found [here](https://geophysics.mines.edu/graduate-program/), and about Mines' AMS graduate programs can be found [here](https://ams.mines.edu/graduate-programs/). In addition to the specific openings currently listed below, I often recruit students for upcoming projects that are not yet listed below. 

### Specific Openings Currently

* I am looking to recruit a graduate student research assistant interested in large-scale fiber optic vibration data analysis, both for seismology and industrial monitoring. This student will collaborate with multiple leading research universities and national labs. This is basic science research (i.e. students can discuss, present, and publish their research), but the funding source is restricted to supporting US citizens only. This position is preferred to begin in Spring 2022, but will remain posted until filled. The students' home department can be in either geophysics or AMS at Colorado School of Mines.

* Postdoctoral research associate: computational scientist focused on environmental and engineering geophysics to begin as soon as January 2022. More info at: [here](https://jobs.mines.edu/en-us/job/495095/postdoctoral-fellow-computational-environmental-and-engineering-geophysics)

* A second postdoctoral position will likely be posted to begin in summer/fall 2022 funded by [NSF CAREER grant 2046387](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2046387). 


### Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships

For US citizens and permanent residents entering graduate school, I encourage you to apply for:
* [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf)
* [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)

I also encourage prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for a grant together, or for a postdoctoral fellowship to contact me. Here are just a couple of opportunities:
* [NSF MPS-Ascend Posdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505879)
* [NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=OMA)
