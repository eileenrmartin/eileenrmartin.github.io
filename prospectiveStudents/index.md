## Prospective Students, Postdocs

Our group regularly has funded research projects going on that can support research assistants. Email me if you're a motivated, curious prospective postdoctoral researcher, graduate student or undergrad student interested in doing research on: 
* imaging science 
* inverse problems 
* computational science, high performance computing
* scientific machine learning
* seismic imaging and source characterization 
* data compression
* working with large streaming data sets
* fiber-optic sensing (or other large-scale geophysical sensing methods)
* signal processing

I am currently recruiting graduate students at Colorado School of Mines in the Department of Geophysics (60%) and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (40%). Students who wish to pursue their Ph.D. with me can apply through either department depending on their background and goals. More details about Mines' Geophysics graduate programs can be found [here](https://geophysics.mines.edu/graduate-program/), and about Mines' AMS graduate programs can be found [here](https://ams.mines.edu/graduate-programs/). In addition to the specific openings currently listed below, I also have some postdoctoral researcher funding, and often recruit students for upcoming projects that are not yet listed below, so please get in touch to discuss opportunities. 

### Specific Openings Currently

* I am looking to recruit a graduate student research assistant interested in large-scale fiber optic vibration data analysis, both for seismology and industrial monitoring. This student will collaborate with multiple leading research universities and national labs. This is basic science research (i.e. students can discuss, present, and publish their research), but the funding source is restricted to supporting US citizens only. The students' home department can be in either geophysics or AMS at Colorado School of Mines.

* I am looking to recruit a graduate student research assistant interested in large-scale scientific data analysis on cloud computing resources. The students' home department can be in either AMS or geophysics at Colorado School of Mines.



### Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships

For prospective Ph.D. students who are US citizens or permanent residents, I encourage you to contact me as you apply for:
* [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf)
* [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)

I also encourage prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for a grant together, or for a postdoctoral fellowship to contact me if you would like to develop a proposal to collaborate. Here are just a couple of opportunities:
* [NSF MPS-Ascend Posdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505879)
* [NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=OMA)
