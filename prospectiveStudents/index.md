## Prospective Students

Our group regularly has funded research projects going on that can support research assistants. Email me if you're a motivated, curious prospective postdoctoral researcher, graduate student or undergrad interested in doing research on: 
* imaging science 
* inverse problems 
* computational science 
* seismic imaging and source detection 
* data compression
* working with large streaming data sets
* fiber-optic sensing (or other large-scale geophysical sensing methods)
* signal processing

In January 2022 I will be moving to Colorado School of Mines in Golden Colorado, and will be an assistant professor in the Department of Geophysics (60%) and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (40%). Students who wish to pursue their Ph.D. with me can apply through either department depending on their background and goals. More details about Mines' Geophysics graduate programs can be found [here](https://geophysics.mines.edu/graduate-program/), and about Mines' AMS graduate programs can be found [here](https://ams.mines.edu/graduate-programs/). Please check back here soon for a postdoctoral position. 

I also encourage prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for a grant together, or for a postdoctoral fellowship to contact me. Here are just a couple of opportunities:
* [Link to the NSF MPS-Ascend Posdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505879)
* [Link to NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=OMA)


For US citizens and permanent residents entering graduate school, I recommend applying for the [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf), a graduate fellowship that provides fantastic computational science resources and training.
