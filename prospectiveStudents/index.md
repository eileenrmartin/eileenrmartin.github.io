## Prospective Students and Postdocs in the Martin Group

Our group regularly has funded research projects going on that can support research assistants. Email me if you're a motivated, curious prospective postdoctoral researcher, graduate student or undergrad student interested in doing research on: 
* imaging science 
* inverse problems 
* computational science, high performance computing
* scientific machine learning
* seismic imaging and source characterization 
* data compression
* working with large streaming data sets
* fiber-optic sensing (or other large-scale geophysical sensing methods)
* signal processing

I am currently recruiting graduate students at Colorado School of Mines in the Department of Geophysics, the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and the interdisciplinary Hydrologic Sciences and Engineering Program. Students who wish to pursue their M.S. or Ph.D. with me can apply through any of these programs depending on their background and goals. 

Here are links with more details about Mines' graduate programs in: 
* [Geophysics]](https://geophysics.mines.edu/graduate-program/)
* [Applied Math and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/graduate-programs/)
* [Hydrologic Science and Engineering](https://hydrology.mines.edu/graduate-program/)

The specific requirements vary by program, but all students in the group must work with an interdisciplinary team. To ensure some common knowledge that facilitates student-to-student collaboration across programs, applicants should have prior coursework or self-study including: programming, differential equations, linear algebra, probability & statistics, mechanics, and electricity & magnetism.
 

### Specific Open Positions
In addition to the specific openings currently listed here, I also recruit motivated postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students for upcoming projects that are not yet listed below, so please get in touch to discuss opportunities!
* I will be recruiting a post-doctoral researcher soon. If you are interested in end-to-end workflows with data compression in scientific computing, applied data science, high-throughput/large-scale seismology, parallel computing and open-source software, please contact me! 
* The Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing Laboratory (Martin, Jin, Shragge, Singha) is posting an undergraduate work-study position this fall for an undergraduate laboratory assistant. 

### Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships

For prospective Ph.D. students who are US citizens or permanent residents, I encourage you to contact me so we can collaborate as you apply for:
* [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf)
* [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)

I also encourage prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for a grant together, or for a postdoctoral fellowship to contact me if you would like to develop a proposal to collaborate. Here are just a couple of opportunities:
* [NSF MPS-Ascend Posdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505879)
* [NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=OMA)
