## Prospective Students

Our group regularly has funded research projects going on that can support research assistants. Email me if you're a motivated, curious prospective postdoctoral researcher, graduate student or undergrad interested in doing research on: 
* imaging science 
* inverse problems 
* computational science 
* seismic imaging and source detection 
* data compression
* working with large streaming data sets
* signal processing

Virginia Tech's math department includes a vibrant community of computational and applied mathematicians. For current students, the department's weekly numerical analysis seminar is a great opportunity to show off your research and find out about other projects currently happening in the department focused on inverse problems, imaging science, numerical PDEs, optimization, numerical linear algebra, dynamical systems, and reduced order models. 


Every other year the VT Department of Mathematics hires a Patricial Caldwell Postdoctoral Fellow who can independently pursue research with faculty mentors. I also encourage prospective postdocs who are interested in applying for a grant together, or for a postdoctoral fellowship to contact me. Here are just a couple of opportunities:
* [Link to the NSF MPS-Ascend Posdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505879)
* [Link to NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144&org=OMA)


More details about our graduate program can be found [here](https://secure.graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/program.htm?programID=002d14431ce38e83011ce38e94040020&nocache=1536867097477), and about the application process can be found [here](https://graduateschool.vt.edu/admissions/how-to-apply.html). Our department's deadline is January 15.
