## Outreach

For the 2019-2020 school year Gretchen Matthews, Lizette Zietsman and I will be organizing a new program, SURE: Speakers and Undergraduate Research Engagement. More information [here](/docs/SURE-poster.pdf). This program is generously supported by the [Virginia Tech Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.vt.edu/) and a [MAA Tensor Women and Mathematics Grant](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/outreach-initiatives/tensor-women-and-mathematics-grants).x

I lead the student committee that organizes Women in Data Science (WiDS) Blacksburg at Virginia Tech. Here's the [program](/docs/WiDS-BBurg-VT-Program-2019.pdf) and a [story](https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2019/02/Science-womenindata_blacksburg_2019conference.html) from our first event in 2019. We're looking forward to growing the event next year!
