## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)). I recently earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Announcements, upcoming talks and papers

* Upcoming invited talk: "Scalable Seismic Acquisition and Algorithms for Next-Generation Engineering Geophysics," [International Conference on Engineering Geophysics, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, 9-12 Oct. 2019](https://seg.org/Events/ICEG19) (conference paper to appear)

* This new [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/sx9zt/) describes "A Scalable Algorithm for Cross-correlations of Compressed Ambient Seismic Noise," and has been accepted to appear in the 2019 SEG Annual Meeting Expanded Abstracts. 

* E. Martin, N. Lindsey, J. Ajo-Franklin, B. Biondi, "Introduction to Interferometry of Fiber Optic Strain Measurements," accepted pending minor revisions, [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/s2tjd/). 

* B. Biondi, S. Yuan, E.R. Martin, F. Huot, R.G. Clapp, "Using telecommunication fiber infrastructure for earthquake monitoring and near-surface characterization," accepted pending minor revisions.

* I recently began the project "Advanced Computational Methods towards High-Resolution Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing,"  a collaboration with [Luna](https://lunainc.com/) funded through a Phase I STTR from DOE Geothermal Technologies Office.  

* Please get in touch with me if you're an undergrad woman at VT interested in being part of the [SURE](/docs/SURE-poster.pdf): Speakers and Undergraduate Research Engagement program in the 2019-2020 school year. 

* Congratulations to Tarun Nadipalli on earning a Hamlett Undergraduate Research Fellowship in VT's Academy of Integrated Sciences! Tarun will use the fellowship to work on efficiently managing data from next-generation seismic sensor networks.

* At the AGU Fall meeting in December, Nate Lindsey and I presented a tutorial on "Distributed Fiber-Optic Seismology in Theory and Practice," and we've turned that material into a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/LAcQ44YRMuM) so it's easy to watch at your own pace. We also include many references at the end if you would like to find out more about some of the recent advances in this area.

* I was awarded the 2018 Gene Golub Dissertation Award by Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. A copy of my dissertation can be found [here](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/docs/sep173/dissertation.pdf).
