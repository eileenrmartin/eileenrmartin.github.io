## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)). I earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford in 2018, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Announcements, upcoming talks and papers

* Upcoming invited talk: "Scalable Seismic Acquisition and Algorithms for Next-Generation Engineering Geophysics," [International Conference on Engineering Geophysics, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, 21-24 Oct. 2019](https://seg.org/Events/ICEG19) (conference paper to appear)

* Recent preprints and publications:
  * New [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/j8vn9/): Z. Spica, M. Perton, E.R. Martin, B. Biondi, G. Beroza, "Urban Seismic Site Characterization by Fiber-Optic Seismology"
  * This [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/sx9zt/) describes "A Scalable Algorithm for Cross-correlations of Compressed Ambient Seismic Noise," and has been accepted to appear in the 2019 SEG Annual Meeting Expanded Abstracts. 
  * E. Martin, N. Lindsey, J. Ajo-Franklin, B. Biondi, "Introduction to Interferometry of Fiber Optic Strain Measurements," accepted pending minor revisions, [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/s2tjd/). 
  * B. Biondi, S. Yuan, E.R. Martin, F. Huot, R.G. Clapp, "Using telecommunication fiber infrastructure for earthquake monitoring and near-surface characterization," accepted pending minor revisions.


* Recent research funding:
  * The project "EAGER: Exploration of an Interdisciplinary Approach to Resolving a Critical Issue in Evaluating Liquefaction Hazard of Challenging Soil Sites" with A. Yerro Colom and R. Green (Virginia Tech Civil & Environmental Engineering) was recently selected for funding by the NSF Engineering for Civil Infrastructure program.
  * The project "Fully Distributed Acoustic and Magnetic Field Monitoring via a Single Fiber Line for Optimized Production of Unconventional Resource Plays," was [recently selected for funding by the DOE Office of Fossil Energy](https://www.energy.gov/fe/project-selections-advanced-technologies-recovery-unconventional-oil-gas-resources). This will be a collaboration with Virginia Tech's [Center for Photonics Technology](https://photonics.ece.vt.edu/) and [Sentek Instrument LLC](http://www.sentekinstrument.com/).
  * We are currently working on "Advanced Computational Methods towards High-Resolution Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing,"  a collaboration with [Luna](https://lunainc.com/) funded through a Phase I STTR from DOE Geothermal Technologies Office
  
  
* Teaching this fall:
  * [Extreme-scale Inverse Problems](https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/extreme) (graduate topics course, Math 5984, co-teaching with Russell Hewett)
  * Integrated Quantitative Modeling I (undergrad CMDA-majors course, CMDA 2005, co-teaching with Morgan Russell)


* Please get in touch with me if you're an undergrad woman at VT interested in being part of the [SURE](/docs/SURE-poster.pdf): Speakers and Undergraduate Research Engagement program in the 2019-2020 school year. 


* At the AGU Fall meeting in December, Nate Lindsey and I presented a tutorial on "Distributed Fiber-Optic Seismology in Theory and Practice," and we've turned that material into a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/LAcQ44YRMuM) so it's easy to watch at your own pace. We also include many references at the end if you would like to find out more about some of the recent advances in this area.

* I was awarded the 2018 Gene Golub Dissertation Award by Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. A copy of my dissertation can be found [here](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/docs/sep173/dissertation.pdf).
