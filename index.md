## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)). I recently earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Announcements, upcoming talks and papers


* At the AGU Fall meeting in December, Nate Lindsey and I presented a tutorial on "Distributed Fiber-Optic Seismology in Theory and Practice," and we've turned that material into a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/LAcQ44YRMuM) so it's easy to watch at your own pace. We also include many references at the end if you would like to find out more about some of the recent advances in this area.

* E. Martin, N. Lindsey, J. Ajo-Franklin, B. Biondi, "Introduction to Interferometry of Fiber Optic Strain Measurements," [preprint on EarthArXiV](https://eartharxiv.org/s2tjd/). 


* I was awarded the 2018 Gene Golub Dissertation Award by Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. A copy of my dissertation can be found [here](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/docs/sep173/dissertation.pdf). 


* ["A Seismic Shift in Scalable Acquisition Demands New Processing: Fiber-Optic Seismic Signal Retrieval in Urban Areas with Unsupervised Learning for Coherent Noise Removal"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310692/) was published in the Mar. 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine special issue on subsurface exploration. 

* ["Fiber-optic network observations of earthquake wavefields"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL075722/full) is on the cover of [the Dec. 2017 issue of GRL](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/issue/10.1002/grl.v44.23/). <img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/GRL-cover-Dec2017.jpg" alt="GRL cover" align="right" style="width: 200px;"/>
