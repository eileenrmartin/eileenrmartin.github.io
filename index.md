## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)), and a Luther and Alice Hamlett Junior Faculty Fellow in Virginia Tech's Academy of Integrated Science. I earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford in 2018, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group and an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (through 2020). I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin. Beginning in January 2022 I will work as an assistant professor at Colorado School of Mines with joint appointments in the [Department of Geophysics](https://geophysics.mines.edu/) (60%) and the [Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://ams.mines.edu/) (40%).
