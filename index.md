## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I'm a PhD student in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford. I've been a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group since summer 2013, and am a student affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Upcoming talks and papers

* I'm looking forward to the upcoming [IRIS Workshop: Foundations, Frontiers, and Future Facilities for Seismology](https://www.iris.edu/hq/workshops/2018/06/iris_workshop_2018), where I'll speak on June 14 about our emerging understanding of fiber optics for earthquake detection and ambient noise imaging.

* ["A Seismic Shift in Scalable Acquisition Demands New Processing: Fiber-Optic Seismic Signal Retrieval in Urban Areas with Unsupervised Learning for Coherent Noise Removal"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310692/) was published in the Mar. 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine special issue on subsurface exploration. 

* ["Fiber-optic network observations of earthquake wavefields"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL075722/full) is on the cover of [the Dec. 2017 issue of GRL](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/issue/10.1002/grl.v44.23/). <img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/GRL-cover-Dec2017.jpg" alt="GRL cover" align="right" style="width: 200px;"/>

* If you are interested in submitting a manuscript to the special section of *Interpretation* on 'Distributed acoustic sensing and its oilfield potential' (submission deadline May 1, 2018) please get in touch with me. 




## Computational Geoscience Seminar Announcement

* We've wrapped up the winter quarter CompGeo seminar series. Thanks to everyone who participated! Let me know if you'd like to help organize this seminar series in the future. The 2018 speaker list can be found [here.](https://pangea.stanford.edu/programs/compgeo/computational-geosciences-seminar-earth-310)
