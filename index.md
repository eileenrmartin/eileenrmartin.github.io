## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I'm a PhD student in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford. I've been a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group since summer 2013, and am a student affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.
