## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Colorado School of Mines jointly appointed in [geophysics](https://geophysics.mines.edu/)  and [applied math and statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) 60/40%. At Mines I am part of two industry-aligned consortia: [Center for Wave Phenomena ](https://cwp.mines.edu/) and [Center to Advance the Science of Exploration to Reclamation in Mining ](https://caserm.mines.edu/). I am also an assistant professor on-leave at Virginia Tech in [math](https://www.math.vt.edu) and [CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html). I earned my PhD from the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu) at Stanford in 2018, where I was a member of the [Stanford Exploration Project](http://sepwww.stanford.edu) group and an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin. I have earned an NSF CAREER grant (2021) and the SIAM Activity Group on Geosciences Early Career Prize (2023).
