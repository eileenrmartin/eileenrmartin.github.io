## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I recently earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin. This fall, I'll move to Virginia Tech to work as an assistant professor in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)).

## Announcements, upcoming talks and papers

* I will speak at the SIAM Annual Meeting in the [Imaging Session](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=65245) on July 9 about "Green's function estimation and correction from strain rate measurements of random seismic noise."

* I was awarded the 2018 Gene Golub Dissertation Award by Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. A copy of my dissertation can be found [here](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/docs/sep173/dissertation.pdf). 

* ["Automatic noise exploration in urban areas"](https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/segam2017-17774369.1), led by Fantine Huot, has been selected for the Award of Merit for Best Student Poster Paper Presented at the 2017 SEG Annual Meeting. 

* ["A Seismic Shift in Scalable Acquisition Demands New Processing: Fiber-Optic Seismic Signal Retrieval in Urban Areas with Unsupervised Learning for Coherent Noise Removal"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310692/) was published in the Mar. 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine special issue on subsurface exploration. 

* ["Fiber-optic network observations of earthquake wavefields"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL075722/full) is on the cover of [the Dec. 2017 issue of GRL](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/issue/10.1002/grl.v44.23/). <img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/GRL-cover-Dec2017.jpg" alt="GRL cover" align="right" style="width: 200px;"/>
