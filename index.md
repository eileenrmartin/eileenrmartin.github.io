## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)), and a Luther and Alice Hamlett Junior Faculty Fellow in Virginia Tech's Academy of Integrated Science. I earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford in 2018, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group and an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (through 2020). I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin. Beginning in January 2022 I will work as an assistant professor at Colorado School of Mines with joint appointments in the [Department of Geophysics](https://geophysics.mines.edu/) (60%) and the [Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department](https://ams.mines.edu/) (40%).

* Recent research funding:
  * The project "CAREER: Scalable Computational Seismology for All" was recently awarded funding by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.
  * The project "SitS: Collaborative Research: Understand and Forecast Long-term Variations of In-situ Geophysical and Geomechanical Characteristics of Degrading Permafrost in the Arctic" will begin in January 2021 with M. Xiao and T. Zhu (Penn State), D. Nicolsky and A. Jensen (University of Alaska Fairbanks), funded by the NSF Signals in the Soil program.
  * The project "Fast Comparative Algorithms for Sensor Array Summaries" is funded through a subcontract with UT-Batelle, LLC (operating Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
  * The project "EAGER: Exploration of an Interdisciplinary Approach to Resolving a Critical Issue in Evaluating Liquefaction Hazard of Challenging Soil Sites" with A. Yerro Colom and R. Green (Virginia Tech Civil & Environmental Engineering) is ongoing, funded by the NSF Engineering for Civil Infrastructure program.
  * The project "Fully Distributed Acoustic and Magnetic Field Monitoring via a Single Fiber Line for Optimized Production of Unconventional Resource Plays," is ongoing, [funded by the DOE Office of Fossil Energy](https://www.energy.gov/fe/project-selections-advanced-technologies-recovery-unconventional-oil-gas-resources). This is a collaboration with Virginia Tech's [Center for Photonics Technology](https://photonics.ece.vt.edu/) and [Sentek Instrument LLC](http://www.sentekinstrument.com/).
  * We recently wrapped up Phase I of "Advanced Computational Methods towards High-Resolution Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing,"  a collaboration with [Luna](https://lunainc.com/) funded through a Phase I STTR from DOE Geothermal Technologies Office.
