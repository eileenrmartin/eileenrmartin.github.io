## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I'm a PhD student in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford. I've been a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group since summer 2013, and am a student affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Upcoming talks and papers

* I will speak about seismic monitoring with fiber optics as part of the Heiland lecture series at Colorado School of Mines the 2nd week of January

* "Fiber optic seismic signal retrieval in an urban area with unsupervised learning for coherent noise removal" was accepted to IEEE Signal Processing Magazine and will appear in the Jan. 2018 special issue on subsurface exploration. 

* "Fiber-optic network observations of earthquake wavefields" was accepted to GRL and is now [available.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL075722/full) 

* An overview of our Stanford DAS Array experimental efforts is in the December issue of [The Leading Edge](https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/tle36121025.1)

## Computational Geoscience Seminar Announcement

* I'm happy to be co-organizing this seminar series in winter quarter, Fridays 12:30-1:30 in Mitchell 350. Talks will highlight numerical methods for applications in Earth sciences, and should be interesting to both Earth scientists and the broader community of computational scientists. If you'd like credit (1 hr. pass/fail) register for EARTH 310, which counts for a seminar requirement for CompGeo ICME MS students.
