## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)). I recently earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

## Announcements, upcoming talks and papers

* At the upcoming SEG Annual Meeting in Anaheim:
  - I'll give two talks:
    -- "Eighteen months of continuous near-surface monitoring with DAS data collected under Stanford University" in the session on VSP, Advanced Processing, and Imaging Approaches for DAS on Oct. 17
    -- "Beyond cosine squared: understanding trends in passive DAS data" in the DAS post-convention workshop on Oct. 19
  - And several of my collaborators will present: 
    -- Siyuan Yuan (PhD student of B. Biondi) will present a poster about his work monitoring two years of earthquakes recorded by the Stanford Fiber Optic Seismic Observatory in the DAS post-convention workshop on Oct. 19
    -- Fantine Huot (PhD student of B. Biondi) will present a talk on Oct. 18 on "Automated ambient noise processing applied to fiber-optic acquisition (DAS)"
    -- Gang Fang (postdoc with Y.E. Li) will present a talk on Oct. 18 on "Near-surface monitoring enabled by distributed acoustic sensing: an example of the Stanford Array Data" which investigate detecting subsurface changes with mine blasts as sources

* At the AGU Fall Meeting in D.C.:
  - I will give an invited talk on "Continuous near-surface imaging with a fiber-optic array beneath Stanford University" in the session on Waveform and Tomographic Inversion for Natural and Induced Seismic Events
  - Nate Lindsey and I will give a tutorial on "Distributed Fiber-Optic Seismology in Theory and Practice"
  - Nate Lindsey will present on "Time-lapse imaging of a controlled permafrost thaw experiment with strongly non-stationary vehicle noise and a 4,000 component distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) array"


* I was awarded the 2018 Gene Golub Dissertation Award by Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering. A copy of my dissertation can be found [here](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/docs/sep173/dissertation.pdf). 


* ["A Seismic Shift in Scalable Acquisition Demands New Processing: Fiber-Optic Seismic Signal Retrieval in Urban Areas with Unsupervised Learning for Coherent Noise Removal"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8310692/) was published in the Mar. 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine special issue on subsurface exploration. 

* ["Fiber-optic network observations of earthquake wavefields"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL075722/full) is on the cover of [the Dec. 2017 issue of GRL](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/issue/10.1002/grl.v44.23/). <img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/GRL-cover-Dec2017.jpg" alt="GRL cover" align="right" style="width: 200px;"/>
