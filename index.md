## Bio

<img src="https://eileenrmartin.github.io/img/eileen.jpg" alt="photo of Eileen" align="right" style="width: 250px;"/>
I am an assistant professor at Virginia Tech in the [math department](https://www.math.vt.edu) and program in computational modeling and data analytics ([CMDA](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/cmda.html)), and a Luther and Alice Hamlett Junior Faculty Fellow in Virginia Tech's Academy of Integrated Science. I earned my PhD from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu)) at Stanford in 2018, where I was a member of the Stanford Exploration Project ([SEP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu)) seismic imaging group. I am an affiliate in the geophysics department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. I hold an MS in geophysics from Stanford, and a BS with a double-major in math and computational physics from UT-Austin.

  * The project "EAGER: Exploration of an Interdisciplinary Approach to Resolving a Critical Issue in Evaluating Liquefaction Hazard of Challenging Soil Sites" with A. Yerro Colom and R. Green (Virginia Tech Civil & Environmental Engineering) was recently selected for funding by the NSF Engineering for Civil Infrastructure program.
  * The project "Fully Distributed Acoustic and Magnetic Field Monitoring via a Single Fiber Line for Optimized Production of Unconventional Resource Plays," was [recently selected for funding by the DOE Office of Fossil Energy](https://www.energy.gov/fe/project-selections-advanced-technologies-recovery-unconventional-oil-gas-resources). This will be a collaboration with Virginia Tech's [Center for Photonics Technology](https://photonics.ece.vt.edu/) and [Sentek Instrument LLC](http://www.sentekinstrument.com/).
  * We recently wrapped up Phase I of "Advanced Computational Methods towards High-Resolution Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing,"  a collaboration with [Luna](https://lunainc.com/) funded through a Phase I STTR from DOE Geothermal Technologies Office. 
  




* At the AGU Fall meeting in December, Nate Lindsey and I presented a tutorial on "Distributed Fiber-Optic Seismology in Theory and Practice," and we've turned that material into a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/LAcQ44YRMuM) so it's easy to watch at your own pace. We also include many references at the end if you would like to find out more about some of the recent advances in this area.
