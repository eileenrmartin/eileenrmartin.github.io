**Description:** Recent advances in many sensor data acquisition technologies paired with new computational algorithms and hardware are making real-time geophysical processing of large-scale streaming data a reality for some applications. This includes highly-instrumented unconventional and conventional fields, next-generation microseismicity monitoring, in-the-field processing of large-scale marine surveys and wireless node land surveys. In this workshop we will explore methods for real-time processing from data to decision. This includes a variety of scalable streaming algorithms including machine learning methods, adaptive pre-processing, automated noise detection and filtering, the detection of weak signals or small changes in noisy data, and fast methods for data reduction, compression or decompression. Some particular questions of interest include: How can real-time processing make a difference in operations and decisions and what are current bottlenecks? How do data acquisition systems shape real-time processing workflows (quality measures, synchronicity between sensors, batch sizes of data, etc.)? What compute resources are expected to be available in the field, and what are the tradeoffs being made to meet these constraints? How can cloud and edge computing play a role in real-time processing, and can we take advantage of new computing paradigms (e.g. map-reduce, randomized approximation algorithms, etc.)? When should machine learning or AI methods be used in lieu of more traditional computational science methods, and how interpretable or generalizable are the results?
