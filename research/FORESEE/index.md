This is a dark-fiber seismic array that has been continuously running under the Penn State campus since April 2019. We are focusing on studying the near-surface hydrology and geohazards in this area, while improving general methodology for passive imaging with dense fiber arrays in urban areas. More information about this project, and more publications related to this project, can be found at the official project [team page.](https://sites.psu.edu/tzhu/foresee/).
