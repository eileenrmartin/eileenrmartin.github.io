## Current projects

### Permafrost thaw monitoring

I collaborate with scientists and engineers from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on seismic data processing for [frequent monitoring](https://www.facebook.com/serdpFiberPermafrost/) of the near-surface to detect permafrost thaw, particularly under infrastructure using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing arrays.

### Repurposing existing infrastructure as seismic arrays

I work with my advisor, Biondo Biondi, and OptaSense to run a fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing array in existing telecommunications conduits underneath the Stanford campus. Goals of the Stanford DAS Array-1 (SDASA-1) include evaluating such a system for: near surface monitoring with ambient seismic noise, active seismic surveys, and earthquake detection. Read a little about the earthquake detection aspects of the project in [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/test-and-measurement/turning-the-optical-fiber-network-into-a-giant-earthquake-sensor).
