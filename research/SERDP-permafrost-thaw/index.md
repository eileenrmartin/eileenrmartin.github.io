## Permafrost thaw monitoring

I collaborate with scientists and engineers from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on seismic data processing for [frequent monitoring](https://www.facebook.com/serdpFiberPermafrost/) of the near-surface to detect permafrost thaw, particularly under infrastructure using fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing arrays.
